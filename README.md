# NgxUi



## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component <component-name> --project=ngx-ui --export
```

## Code Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules.

### Format your code

To format all files in the project, run:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Check formatting

To check if your files are properly formatted without making changes, run:

```bash
npm run format:check
```

### Configuration

Prettier configuration is defined in the `.prettierrc` file at the root of the project. Files and directories excluded from formatting are specified in the `.prettierignore` file.
